        <p> I worked for Adler Planetarium in a program called HackLabs from February 2016 to April 2016. I successfully made a presentation about traffic control around Adler. I will graduate from Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences in the year of 2018.         
My interests are coding, video gaming, programming, relaxation and sleeping.</p>
        <p2> I don't know what I want to do for the future. As long as I enjoy it, its all good.</p2>
